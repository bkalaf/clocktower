Ok, I need custom "cards" made for the same purpose I said but let's go about this a different way. I'll list the cards I need and the text I need on them and let you generate sufficient cards. I'm thinking a tarot deck would be an awesome background. They don't have to all be from the same deck but I really like the though of the tarot card look being the theme behind these communication cards for botc. Here is the card I need: * 1
Model this after the 1 of swords, cups, pentacles or wands.
Model this after the Sun Major Arcana Card.

While I do that I'd like you to look at the following image of what I'd like the grimoire to look like and see if you can't come up with a successful way to producing this kind of an output (assuming I have png images for all the tokens show and such...) and producing the UI component code for React. Come up with the outline for codex that would accomplish this goal. I particularly would like to identify the font or a similar free font on google fonts for the word vizier in the vizier.png image. There are a couple of modals shows that I'd like to try to duplicate if at all possible as well.

Adjust the prompt to also include this information that I just found - the example screenshots I made are in a public github repository. This might be a good baseline starting point and I can adjust from there. The only issue is that it's written in vue and I don't know it well enough to decipher it. Can we just convert the UI pieces to React which I am familiar with and go from there? Also, include add Cinzel into the prompt as well for codex. The github repo is @ https://github.com/bra1n/townsquare.git. I also have cloned it locally at /home/bobby/townsquare/townsquare so codex can see it there since i'm using codex locally.

When I originally sent these two previous prompts but I forgot to include a couple of constraints so let's redo the prompts:
* All files must have a comment at the top showing it's relative path and name in the repo
* Use shadcn components for the UI design
* Review the current repo and try to incorporate all the current pieces that aren't hooked up but clearly should be (there are lots of orphaned components)
* Keep to the original design if you can and try to model ALL the Vue components in the repo listed
* Use the images in src/assets/images - all the items from the listed repo are copied here for us to use
* src/assets/images/tokens-desk-window.png should be the default background for the app
* src/assets/images/neptune-pool.png is the background for any modal
* use font-rubik as the default fault for the app with the only exception being Cinzel (get that in css if it's not there) this is the font for the curved bottom text on the tokens
* src/assets/icons houses all the character icons make components in /src/components for each character icon - also review /src/assets/data/roles.json and make reminder tokens (the smaller ones in the app - maybe called night tokens for each string in the reminders field of the objects in the array; reminder token keys are simple the "id" + snake cased reminder with the background of the id + ".png" from that icons folder. Reminder token text "reminders" property aren't curved and Cinzel those should use Rubik. (So we should have hard implements for all the characters in roles and all the reminder tokens at the end of this. Put the big tokens in /src/components/tokens/${id} as Token and the reminders in the same folder with names Reminder_${id}_${$reminder}. example: /src/components/tokens/washerwoman would have /src/components/tokens/washerwoman/Token.tsx; /src/components/tokens/washerwoman/Reminder_washerwoman_wrong.tsx; /src/components/tokens/washerwoman/Reminder_washerwoman_townsfolk.tsx from that data. Do the same for /src/assets/data/fabled.json with the same pattern.

Based on what each of these tarot cards represents, pair up these storyteller communication cards, gestures, or info tokens (calling these things st-cards for clarity from here out) with it's best match from the tarot deck list... If you match one of these to a tarot card that already has an st-card assigned to it each of those st-cards plust the one your matching must be matched to an additional item. Match based on appearance primarily and then on the name of the cards meaning and then on the tarot meaning of the card. You can also match to a tarot card in it's inverted (upside-down) state. 

MAJOR ARCANA (Big, structural signals)
The Fool

ST-cards

“Wake up”

“Go back to sleep”

Why
Beginnings, transitions, stepping into or out of awareness. The Fool is literally the threshold between states.

The Magician

ST-cards

“Use your ability”

“Use your ability tonight”

Why
Agency, will, deliberate action. The Magician is the act of doing.

The High Priestess

ST-cards

“These characters are not in play”

“This character is in play”

Why
Hidden knowledge, revealed vs concealed information. She guards the veil.

The Empress

ST-cards

“Good”

Thumbs up (Good)

Why
Nurturing, life, affirmation, creation.

The Emperor

ST-cards

“Evil”

Thumbs down (Evil)

Why
Authority, dominance, force. The Emperor is rule through power.

The Hierophant

ST-cards

“To be mad”

“We should chat tomorrow”

Why
Rules, doctrine, enforced belief. Madness in BOTC is enforced orthodoxy, not emotion.

The Lovers

ST-cards

“Choose two players”

“Your fellow minions are”

Why
Partnership, alignment, shared identity.

The Chariot

ST-cards

“Clockwise”

“Anti-clockwise”

Why
Direction, motion, control of flow.

Strength

ST-cards

“Yes”

Nodding (Yes)

Why
Gentle force, quiet affirmation, calm certainty.

The Hermit

ST-cards

“Neither”

“Neutral”

Why
Withdrawal from binaries. Standing outside Good/Evil.

Wheel of Fortune

ST-cards

“0”

“10”

Why
Cycles, extremes, turning points.

Justice

ST-cards

“Did you nominate yesterday”

“Did you vote yesterday”

Why
Accountability, past actions, balance of consequence.

The Hanged Man

ST-cards

“You are” (alignment change)

“This character selected you”

Why
Loss of control, being acted upon, altered perspective.

Death

ST-cards

“I made a mistake this is my correction”

Why
Endings, resets, clean transitions. Not punishment—correction.

Temperance

ST-cards

“Choose a character”

“Make a choice”

Why
Deliberation, careful selection, balance.

The Devil

ST-cards

“These are your Minions”

Why
Bondage, enforced allegiance, known corruption.

The Tower

ST-cards

“This is the demon”

Why
Sudden revelation, catastrophic truth, structure collapse.

The Star

ST-cards

“1”

Why
Hope, the first light after chaos.

The Moon

ST-cards

“This player is”

(used for Lunatic, misinformation)

Why
Illusion, uncertainty, false reflections.

The Sun

ST-cards

“Yes” (clarifying answer)

Explicit confirmation gestures

Why
Clarity, certainty, open truth.

Secondary support: Ace of Swords (clarified truth)

Judgement

ST-cards

“Did you vote yesterday”

“Did you nominate yesterday”

(Yes, shared with Justice—but here it’s reckoning, not balance.)

The World

ST-cards

“Wake up”

“Go back to sleep” (end of phase)

Why
Completion, closure, full cycle resolved.

MINOR ARCANA (Operational signals)
Ace of Cups

ST-cards

“Good”

Why
Pure emotional/alignment signal.

Two of Cups

ST-cards

“Choose two players”

Three of Cups

ST-cards

“Your fellow minions are”

Four of Cups (Reversed)

ST-cards

“Neither”

“Neutral”

Five of Cups

ST-cards

“No” (Good)

Why
Disappointment, loss, negation.

Ace of Swords

ST-cards

“This character is in play”

“This character selected you”

Why
Sharp, precise information.

Two of Swords

ST-cards

“Choose a player”

Eight of Swords

ST-cards

“You are” (forced alignment)

Ten of Swords

ST-cards

“I made a mistake this is my correction”

(shared thematic with Death; this is the painful version)

Page of Swords

ST-cards

“This player is”

Ace of Wands

ST-cards

“Use your ability”

Knight of Wands

ST-cards

“Use your ability tonight”

Ace of Pentacles

ST-cards

“0”

Why
Baseline state, material start.

Ten of Pentacles

ST-cards

“10”

Why
Maximum completion, full structure.

Number Cards (Pentacles)

ST-cards

“1” through “9”

Mapped directly by numeral symbolism.

Final Note (the honest bit)

This mapping works because BOTC storytelling language is ritualized, and tarot is a symbolic protocol. You’re essentially aligning two symbolic operating systems. The cleanest matches come when control, knowledge, and agency line up—Magician, High Priestess, Devil, Tower doing the heavy lifting.

If you push this further, the next logical step is:

Assign one Major Arcana per night phase

Use Minors only for mechanical clarification

At that point, you’re no longer just signaling—you’re composing.
