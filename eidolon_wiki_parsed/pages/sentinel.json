Many of the games you create using the Script Tool will not have this luxury. If, for one reason or another, the number of Outsiders in a game will become certain, the Storyteller can add a Sentinel. This will confuse matters and help the evil team either bluff as Outsiders or make existing Outsiders look suspicious.\n-  Games with a Sentinel in play might have one more Outsider than normal.

  "howToRun": "At the start of the game, declare that the Sentinel is in play. Add the Sentinel token to the Grimoire.\n\nWhile setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, add an Outsider token and remove a Townsfolk token, remove an Outsider token and add a Townsfolk token, or do neither.",

    "There are seven players in this game. There are no characters on the character list that add Outsiders. The Demon bluffs as the Saint. A Sentinel is in play, so the good players are not sure if there is actually a Saint or not.",
    "There are nine players in this game. Even though a Baron is on the character list, the good players know no Baron is in play because the Witch just killed a player, so there should be just two Outsiders in play. However, the Outsiders cannot be trusted because a Sentinel is in play. Indeed, there is one less Outsider than normal in this game, and the Witch is bluffing as the Butler."
