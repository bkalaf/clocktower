  "summary": "The Big Wig gives nominees a defence lawyer.\n-  When nominated, that player must choose a player to speak on their behalf. They may choose living or dead players.\n-  Other players are not allowed to speak during this period. This includes the nominated player. If necessary, the Storyteller may use the Hell’s Librarian to enforce this.\n-  If the chosen player is mad that the nominee is evil, or not mad enough that the nominee is good, the Storyteller might kill that player.\n-  Being mad that ‘the nominee should not be executed’ might be similar enough to being mad that ‘the nominee is good’ to avoid being killed by the Storyteller.\n-  The Storyteller will make it obvious when the period of silence begins. It ends when voting begins.\n-  The player chosen by the nominee may vote for the nominee.",

    "Alex is claiming to be the Sailor, and is nominated. Alex chooses Evin to speak on his behalf. Evin makes a convincing argument that Alex actually is the Sailor, and that Julian should be executed instead. Evin lives.",
    "Marianna is the Hermit, but has not told many people that she is the Hermit. When nominated, she chooses Alex to defend her. Alex says that Marianna is probably a Minion and that it doesn’t matter if Marianna dies or not. Alex dies due to the Big Wig ability."
