Whilst it is not necessary, even a minor chance of a good player’s information being incorrect can drastically help the evil players bluff.\n-  The Fibbin does not make an ability fail in the way that drunkenness and poisoning do. It only affects abilities that provide information from the Storyteller signaling to a player during the night or telling them something.\n-  If the game ends before you have given a good player incorrect information, that’s okay.\n-  Some characters get false information due to their ability. The Fibbin can make this information true.",
