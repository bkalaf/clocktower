    "Bluffing as the Clockmaker": "When bluffing as the Clockmaker, there are a few things you should keep in mind:\n-  The standard, easiest way to bluff as the Clockmaker is to tell the group false information on the first day. Since you know how many steps the Demon and Minion are from each other, this incorrect information can lead the good team down the garden path for several days. Remember that a \"1\" means that the Demon and Minion are sitting next to each other.\n-  Giving correct Clockmaker information can actually be quite helpful to the evil team. If they believe that you are good, they will believe your information, and therefore not consider you as a Minion or Demon when figuring out the Clockmaker information, and therefore not arrive at the actual Demon. If instead they believe that you are evil, they will believe that you gave false information, and again avoid the actual Demon.\n-  Surviving the first day is crucial if you are the Demon bluffing as the Clockmaker. As the only character in Sects & Violets that gets information on the first night, and never again, beginner good players will have a tendency to want to execute the Clockmaker on the first day. Waiting until you reveal that you are the Clockmaker until the second day, or beyond, can help you survive the earlier, riskier stages of the game.\n-  Choosing small numbers to give as false information is usually best. If the number you give is half the number of players, then that implies that the Demon and Minion are sitting exactly opposite each other, since either clockwise or anti-clockwise, steps from one player end up at the same player. Also, in games with several Minions, large numbers may imply that the Minions are all sitting in a bunch, which the good players may not believe. Smaller numbers can be just as confusing as bigger numbers. Think carefully about what number you choose.\n-  Since the good team can often get a good idea of who the Minions are by the disappearance of obvious Minion abilities from the game, it can throw a spanner in the works if you kill an obvious-acting Minion at night time. For example, the good team will often realize when they have executed a Pit-Hag (since no more players are changing characters at night), and the heat will be on you to either prove or disprove your Clockmaker information, by killing the player that would be the Demon. However, if you killed the Pit-Hag at night, then the good players are likely to believe that the player executed during the day was actually the Pit-Hag. This may help or hinder your cause, depending on what the good players believe, particularly if they believe a Vortox is in play or not.",
    "Tips & Tricks": "-  You don't have to give your information out immediately; wait a couple of days so that you can observe the other players and see if you uncover anything suspicious while the evil team thinks the pressure is off.\n-  Your information is most valuable if you can identify a Minion. Figure out which player is a Minion, and you can pin down some very likely Demon suspects. You should try to coordinate with other good players in the game to uncover this information. Many players detect players of an evil alignment (like the Oracle and the Seamstress), while others detect the Demons and Minions directly (like the Flowergirl, Town Crier, or even the Snake Charmer).\n-  If you get a very large number (> 3), then the Minions are probably sitting close together and away from their Demon. Similarly, if you get a very small number ("
