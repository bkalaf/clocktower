It can be tough to be funny when one is expected to be, after all.\n\nIf the player would prefer, you may determine different criteria for whether the Deviant is exiled. If being “funny” is difficult, you may reward the Deviant who “creates a positive mood” or “is helpful to others” instead. The Deviant is not a serious character, and it is meant to encourage laughter, lightheartedness, and fun, so adjust the Deviant rules to your players’ needs and talents.",

Good luck :)\n-  If you are the Deviant, but find it too much of a challenge to be funny on call, talk to the Storyteller.
