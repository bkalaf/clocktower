  "summary": "The Investigator learns that a particular Minion character is in play, but not exactly which player it is.\n-  During the first night, the Investigator learns that one of two players is a specific Minion.\n-  They learn this only once and then learn nothing more.",
  "howToRun": "While preparing the first night, put the Investigator's MINION reminder token by any Minion character token, and put the Investigator's WRONG reminder token by any other character token.\n\nDuring the first night, wake the Investigator and point to the players marked MINION and WRONG. Show the character token marked MINION to the Investigator. Put the Investigator to sleep. Remove the Investigator's reminder tokens when convenient.",
  "examples": [
    "Amy is the Baron, and Julian is the Mayor. The Investigator learns that either Amy or Julian is the Baron.",
    "Angelus is the Spy, and Lewis is the Poisoner. The Investigator learns that either Angelus or Lewis is the Spy.",
    "Brianna is the Recluse, and Marianna is the Imp. The Investigator learns that either Brianna or Marianna is the Poisoner. (This happens because the Recluse is registering as a Minion—in this case, the Poisoner.)"
