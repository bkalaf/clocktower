  "abilityText": "If 4 or more players live, each living player may publicly choose (once per game) that a player of their own alignment dies.",
  "summary": "Use the Doomsayer to make large games take less time.\n-  The Doomsayer allows players to sacrifice their allies in order to gain information, which shortens the game.\n-  Only alive players may use the Doomsayer ability, and each may do so only once per game. It is their responsibility to remember to not use it again.\n-  If a player says something like “I use the Doomsayer ability,” then the Storyteller chooses which player to kill, but they must kill an alive player of the same alignment as the player who used the Doomsayer ability. So, if a good player uses the ability, then a good player dies. If an evil player uses the ability, then an evil player dies.\n-  Once three players are left alive, the Doomsayer ability may no longer be used.",
  "howToRun": "At any time, declare that the Doomsayer is in play. Add the Doomsayer token to the Grimoire.\n\nAt any time during the day, if four or more players are alive, a player can declare that they wish to use the Doomsayer ability. When this happens, choose one player of the same alignment. The chosen player dies.\n\nYou won’t want to kill the Demon this way, unless the game can continue afterwards for some reason, such as if a Scarlet Woman is in play.",
  "examples": [
    "The Monk uses the Doomsayer ability, and the Washerwoman dies. Later that day, the Poisoner uses the Doomsayer ability, and the Baron dies.",
    "An evil  uses the Doomsayer ability, and the Scarlet Woman dies. Later, the Spy uses the Doomsayer ability, and the good  dies. Later, the Demon uses the Doomsayer ability, and the Spy dies."
