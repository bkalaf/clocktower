  "summary": "The Pixie pretends to be the same character as someone else. \n-  On the first night, the Pixie learns an in-play Townsfolk. The Storyteller chooses which Townsfolk this is. The Pixie does not learn which player is this character.\n-  If the Pixie player pretends that they are this Townsfolk, they gain the ability of this Townsfolk when the Townsfolk dies. They could have spoken loudly about being the character for one day, or pretended to be the character each day this game, or accused the Townsfolk of being a liar—the Storyteller is the judge of whether or not the player was convincing, by “being mad that they are this character”.\n-  When the Townsfolk player dies, the Pixie does not learn this, and is not told that they have gained a new ability. They may learn this has happened if they wake at night and start gaining information, or are prompted to choose players.\n-  If the player the Pixie learns about changes character then dies, the Pixie gains the ability of the Townsfolk the Pixie learnt about, not the new character.",
  "howToRun": "During the first night, mark a Townsfolk character token with the Pixie’s MAD reminder. Wake the Pixie. Show the Pixie this Townsfolk character token. Put the Pixie to sleep.\n\nIf the Townsfolk marked MAD dies, and you feel that the Pixie player has been sufficiently mad that they were this character, replace the MAD reminder with the HAS ABILITY reminder. The Pixie now has this Townsfolk’s ability, and will wake at night when this Townsfolk would normally wake.",
  "examples": [
    "Amy is the Pixie, and knows that the Washerwoman is in play. For three days, Amy claims that the Washerwoman player is lying, because she is the Washerwoman. The Washerwoman is executed. That night, Amy gains the Washerwoman ability, and learns that one of two people is the Monk.",
    "Doug is the Drunk Pixie. He learns that the Lycanthrope is in play. There is no Lycanthrope in play, but a Minion bluffs as the Lycanthrope. The Minion dies. The Storyteller wakes Doug and Doug chooses a player to “attack” each night, but they do not die because Doug does not have the Lycanthrope ability.",
    "On the first day, the Pixie player claims to be the Soldier. The real Soldier also claims to be the Soldier. The Pixie player doesn’t dispute this. When the Soldier dies, the Pixie player does not gain the Soldier ability, as the Storyteller feels that the Pixie did not really pretend to be the Soldier."
