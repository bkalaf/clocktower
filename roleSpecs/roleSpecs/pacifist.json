  "summary": "The Pacifist prevents good players from dying by execution.\n-  When a good player is executed, the Storyteller chooses whether they die or live.\n-  As always, when abilities like this function in obvious ways, the group is not told why something has happened, only what has happened. The group learns that an execution succeeded, but that the executed player did not die—that is all.\n-  If a player is executed and remains alive, that still counts as the execution for today. No other nominations may happen.",
  "howToRun": "If a good character is executed, declare either that they die or they remain alive. (Do not say why.) Then, begin the night phase. (Whether the player lived or died, this was the one execution for the day.)\n\nTriggering the Pacifist ability once per game is usually about right. You can trigger it more if you feel it is appropriate. On rare occasions, to make the Pacifist look suspicious, you can never trigger it.",
  "examples": [
    "The Innkeeper is executed, but remains alive because of the Pacifist.",
    "The Pacifist is in play. Good is winning. Even after 7 days, and 5 good players executed, the Pacifist ability has not saved anybody.",
    "The Pacifist is in play. Evil is winning. The Lunatic is executed, but remains alive. The next day, the Professor is executed and dies, because the Pacifist is drunk. The next day, a good  is exiled and dies, because the Pacifist saves people from execution, not exile. The next day, the Pacifist is executed but remains alive because of the Pacifist."
