  "abilityText": "The Storyteller can break the game rules, and if executed, good wins, even if you are dead. [No evil characters]",
  "summary": "The Atheist knows that all players are good and there is no such thing as Demons.\n-  With the Atheist in play, there are no evil players—no Minions and no Demons.\n-  Good wins if the Storyteller is executed. Any living player may nominate the Storyteller, and the Storyteller is executed if 50% or more of the living players vote.\n-  If the Atheist is not in play and the Storyteller is executed, evil wins.\n-  Good loses if just two players are alive.\n-  The Storyteller may break any of the game’s rules. They may kill a player who nominated to simulate a Witch curse, kill players at night to simulate a Demon attacking, give players false information to simulate drunkenness, change characters at night to simulate a Pit-Hag, or even have the wrong number of Outsiders in play.",
  "howToRun": "During setup, before giving the bag to the players, remove all evil character tokens and add Townsfolk or Outsider character tokens to match the player count. \n\nBreak any game rules, as you see fit. Use evil reminder tokens if you need them.\n\nThe Atheist is a complex character, and is recommended for experienced Storytellers. In addition to rules knowledge, it requires you to have a good sense of fun and fairness. It is your job to create a fun game for all players, so only break the game rules to give false information (as much or as little as you want) or simulate the actions of evil characters that could be in play, but aren’t. If you can convince the players that there is no Atheist in play, or at least get them discussing the possibility, you’ve done well.\n\nAvoid creating arbitrary rules or changing the win conditions. In order to have a good time, the players need to know how they can win the game if an Atheist is in play.",
  "examples": [
    "The Investigator learns that either the Grandmother or the Seamstress is the Boomdandy. The Sweetheart nominates, and dies, even though there is no Witch in play. The Slayer uses their ability on the Gossip, who dies.",
    "There are three Outsiders in play, when there should be two. The players execute the Storyteller. Good wins."
