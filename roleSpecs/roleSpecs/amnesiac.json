  "summary": "The Amnesiac doesn’t know their own ability.\n-  The Storyteller decides what the Amnesiac’s ability is. It may be the same ability as another character in Blood On The Clocktower, something similar, or something original.\n-  The Amnesiac may wake at any time during the night to learn information or to choose a player, or their ability may be passive—not requiring action from the Amnesiac player.\n-  Each day, the Amnesiac talks to the Storyteller in private, and makes a guess as to what their ability is. The Storyteller answers “cold” if the guess is very wrong, “warm” if the guess is on the right track, “hot” if the guess is very close, and “bingo” if the guess is spot on.\n-  Their guess may be specific, such as “Am I learning two players each night that are the same alignment?”, or vague, such as “Is my ability something to do with dead players?”",
  "howToRun": "During setup, decide what ability the Amnesiac player has. During the game, treat that player as if they had that ability, waking them when needed, prompting them to choose players when needed, or whatever else is appropriate. Use the Amnesiac’s ? reminders if you need to.\n\nEach day, the Amnesiac makes a guess about their ability in private. Answer “Cold”, “Warm”, “Hot\", or “Bingo”.\n\nMake the Amnesiac’s ability guessable, so that the Amnesiac can figure out what their ability is over time. Learning a piece of information each night, or a power that affects the game in a way that the Amnesiac notices, are both good ideas.\n\nIf the Amnesiac guesses their ability, but the wording is different, still tell them they guessed correctly.\n\nYou can make the Amnesiac’s ability slightly better than a normal Townsfolk’s ability. Not knowing what it is, the player will need to work harder to receive its full benefit.",
  "examples": [
    "Each night, the Amnesiac wakes and is prompted to point at two players. The Storyteller shakes their head on the first night, and nods on the second. The Amnesiac guesses “Am I learning if both players are Minions?” The Storyteller says “Hot” because their ability is that they detect if either of the two players are a Minion.",
    "Each night, the Amnesiac learns a number. The Amnesiac is learning how many of their living neighbours are Townsfolk."
