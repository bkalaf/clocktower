  "abilityText": "All players know you are the Vizier. You cannot die during the day. If good voted, you may choose to execute immediately.",
  "summary": "The Vizier executes players without the town’s consent.\n-  On the first day, all players learn that the Vizier is in play, and which player it is.\n-  During the day, the Vizier can not die by any means.\n-  After a vote is tallied, if the Vizier chooses to execute the nominee (and at least one good player voted), they are executed immediately. This counts as the 1 execution allowed each day.\n-  After a vote is tallied, if the Vizier chooses to execute the nominee (and no good players voted), nothing happens.\n-  Even if the vote tally is less than 50% of the living players, the Vizier may still execute. Even if another player has more votes than the current player, the Vizier may still execute.\n-  The Vizier does not have to force an execution each day.",
  "howToRun": "When the first night has ended, declare that the Vizier is in play, and which player it is.\nIf a vote has just been tallied, and one or more good players voted, and the Vizier declares that the nominee is executed, that player is executed and dies. No more nominations, votes, or executions occur today.",
  "examples": [
    "The King has been nominated. Five people vote, but the Vizier does not use their ability. The Boomdandy is nominated and eight people vote. The Vizier uses their ability and the Boomdandy is executed immediately.",
    "The Demon has seven votes against them, and is “about to die”. The Vizier nominates Bill, the Barber. Two evil players and one good player vote. The Vizier declares that Bill is executed. The Demon survives today.",
    "The town nominates and executes the Vizier. The Vizier does not die. That night, The Demon kills the Vizier."
