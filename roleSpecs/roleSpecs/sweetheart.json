  "howToRun": "If the Sweetheart dies, you choose any one player to become drunk - mark this player with the DRUNK reminder. The Sweetheart does not lose this ability when dead.\n\nYou will almost always want to make a Townsfolk drunk, which will hurt the good team, but if evil is winning quite convincingly, you can make an Outsider, Minion, or even the Demon drunk.",
