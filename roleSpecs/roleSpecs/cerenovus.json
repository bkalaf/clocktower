  "abilityText": "Each night, choose a player & a good character: they are \"mad\" they are this character tomorrow, or might be executed.",
  "summary": "The Cerenovus encourages players to pretend to be different characters than they actually are.\n-  The Cerenovus chooses Townsfolk or Outsiders that players are mad about being. They must try to convince the group that they actually are this character tomorrow, or else die.\n-  Simply hinting is not enough to avoid death. The player must make a decent effort to convince the group. Mad players are never literally forced to say things they don’t want to—but if the Storyteller doesn’t hear them make an effort, they pay the price.\n-  Mad evil players might be executed this way, but “might” means you can choose not to, to prevent evil from winning by this strategy.\n-  Like the Mutant, an execution penalty counts as the one execution allowed per day.",
  "howToRun": "Each night, wake the Cerenovus. They point at any player and at any Townsfolk or Outsider icon on their character sheet. Put the Cerenovus to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the MAD reminder. Wake this player, show them the THIS CHARACTER SELECTED YOU info token, then the Cerenovus token, then the character token of the character they are mad about being. Put that player to sleep.\n\nDuring the next day or night, if you feel that the mad player has not done their best to convince the group they are this character, you can decide to execute them. Declare this to the group. They die. If you execute them during the day before the normal execution happens, go to the night phase. (There is a maximum of one execution per day.)",
  "examples": [
    "The Cerenovus makes the Barber mad about being the Savant. Tomorrow, the Barber claims to be the Savant, talks to the Storyteller, and tells the group two facts that they made up. When asked whether they are mad, the Barber says \"no\" emphatically, so avoids being executed.",
    "The dead Artist is made mad about being the Sage. The next day, they say nothing about being the Sage. The Artist is executed.",
    "The Cerenovus makes the Flowergirl mad about being the Clockmaker. The Flowergirl says to the group that they are the Clockmaker and learned a \"2,” but hints privately to other players that they are mad. The Storyteller overhears this and executes the Flowergirl."
