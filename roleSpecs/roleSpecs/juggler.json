  "abilityText": "On your 1st day, publicly guess up to 5 players' characters. That night, you learn how many you got correct.",
  "summary": "The Juggler takes the risk of convincing people to reveal their characters on the 1st day, in the hope of guessing as many as possible that are telling the truth.\n-  On the first day, they may guess which players are which characters. That night, the Juggler learns how many guesses they got right...if they are not killed beforehand.\n-  They must make their guesses publicly, so everyone hears what is guessed. They may guess zero characters, or up to five characters, and these characters and players may be different or the same.\n-  If the Juggler made their guesses while drunk or poisoned, but is sober and healthy when their ability triggers that night, then the Storyteller still gives them true information.",
  "howToRun": "During the first day, if the Juggler declares that they are using their ability, then you enter the circle, holding the Grimoire. The Juggler can make up to five guesses, each of any one player and any one character. For each correct guess, mark the Juggler with a CORRECT reminder. (Make sure the players don’t see how many reminders you’re placing.)\n\nThat night, wake the Juggler. Show them fingers (0, 1, 2, etc.) equaling the number of CORRECT reminders. Put the Juggler to sleep. Remove the CORRECT reminders and the Juggler’s night token when convenient.\n\nIf the Juggler is guessing too fast, prompt them to slow down.\n\nIf an evil player is bluffing as the Juggler, it can help their bluff if you pretend to move tokens around the Grimoire as they make their fake guesses.",
  "examples": [
    "During the first day, the Juggler guesses that Alex is the Town Crier, Mia is the No Dashii, and Julian is the Sage. That night, the Juggler learns a \"2,\" meaning two of those guesses were correct.",
    "During the fourth night, the Savant gets turned into the Juggler. The next day, the new Juggler guesses that Benjamin is the Pit-Hag, that Benjamin is the Witch, and that Amy is the Pit-Hag. That night, the Juggler learns a \"1.”"
