  "abilityText": "You start knowing a secret word. The 1st good player to say this word becomes evil that night.",
  "summary": "The Mezepheles offers good players a choice: to turn evil or not.  \n-  On the first night, the Mezepheles learns a secret word from the Storyteller.\n-  If a good player says this word, either publicly or privately, they turn evil that night. The Storyteller needs to hear this player actually say the word before turning them evil.\n-  The Mezepheles does not learn if a player turns evil. The good player learns if they turn evil, but not until that night.\n-  If the Mezepheles is sober and healthy at night, the good player turns evil even if the Mezepheles was drunk or poisoned when the good player spoke the secret word. If the Mezepheles is drunk or poisoned at night when a player would turn evil, the player stays good—the Mezepheles has “used their ability” and may not turn a player evil later on.",
  "howToRun": "While setting up the game, write a single word on a piece of paper or on a phone or other device. During the first night, wake the Mezepheles, show the written word, then put them to sleep.\n\nThe first time you hear a good player say the secret word, mark them with the TURNS EVIL reminder.\n\nEach night, if a player is marked with the TURNS EVIL reminder, wake them. Show the YOU ARE info token then give a thumbs down. Put them to sleep. Turn their character token upside down. (This shows they are now evil.) The Mezepheles loses their ability—mark them with the NO ABILITY reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.\n\nChoose an unusual word that would never be spoken accidentally. You can even make one up. The fun lies in the Mezepheles taking a risk to secretly convince a good player to turn evil, not in a good player unexpectedly changing teams.",
  "examples": [
    "The Mezepheles tells the Barber that the secret word is “Rumplestiltskin”. The Barber publicly says “This reminds me of the fairy tale where the Miller’s daughter has to guess Rumplestiltskin’s name”. The Barber turns evil that night.",
    "The Mezepheles tells the Mayor the secret word. The Mayor, wanting to stay good, tells the group who the Mezepheles is.",
    "The Mezepheles privately tells the Noble the secret word – “Constantinople”. The Noble visits the Storyteller and says “Constantinople” in private. That night, the Courtier makes the Mezepheles drunk. The Noble stays good."
