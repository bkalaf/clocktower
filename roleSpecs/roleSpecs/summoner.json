  "abilityText": "You get 3 bluffs. On the 3rd night, choose a player: they become an evil Demon of your choice. [No Demon]",
  "summary": "The Summoner creates a Demon.\n-  The Summoner may choose any player to become the Demon, even themselves.\n-  The new Demon does not learn which players are Minions, or vice versa. The evil players will need to talk amongst themselves to figure this out.\n-  Even though there is no Demon in play for two days, the game does not end. However, if the Summoner becomes unable to create a Demon (due to dying, becoming drunk on night 3 etc.) good wins.\n-  The newly created Demon acts on the same night that it is created.",
  "howToRun": "During the setup phase, remove the Demon and add a Townsfolk.\n\nWhen preparing the first night, put the Summoner’s NIGHT 1 reminder by the Summoner. When preparing the second night, put the Summoner’s NIGHT 2 reminder by the Summoner. When preparing the third night, put the Summoner’s NIGHT 3 reminder by the Summoner.\n\nDuring the first night, show the Summoner 3 not-in-play characters as bluffs.\n\nDuring the night, if the Summoner has a NIGHT 3 reminder, wake the Summoner. They point at a player, and to a Demon icon on the character sheet. Put the Summoner to sleep. Wake the chosen player. Show the YOU ARE info token, then the Demon token. Show the YOU ARE info token, then give a thumbs down. Replace their character token with the Demon token and put the new Demon to sleep.",
  "examples": [
    "On the third night, the Summoner chooses the Snitch player, and the Lleech. The Snitch becomes the evil Lleech, and chooses a player to poison, and a player to kill.",
    "On the first day, the Summoner is executed. Good wins.",
    "On the third night, the Summoner turns the Alchemist into the Leviathan. At dawn, all players learn that Leviathan is in play, and that it is day three of five."
