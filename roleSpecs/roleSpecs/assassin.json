  "summary": "The Assassin kills who the Demon cannot.\n-  Once per game at night, the Assassin can kill a player. This player dies, even if they are protected from death in any way, such as from an ability.\n-  The Assassin ability is affected by drunkenness and poisoning, as normal.\n-  If the Assassin attacks the Goon, the Goon dies and turns evil.",
  "howToRun": "Each night except the first, wake the Assassin. They either shake their head no or point at any player. Put the Assassin to sleep. \n\nIf the Assassin chose a player, that player dies— mark them with the DEAD reminder. This cannot be prevented in any way (except if the Assassin doesn’t have their ability, such as if they’re drunk or poisoned). The Assassin loses their ability—mark them with the NO ABILITY reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet. (The Assassin won’t wake again.)",
  "examples": [
    "For the first three nights the Assassin wakes, but chooses not to act. During the fourth night, they choose to kill the Fool. Even though the Fool still has their ability, the Fool dies and stays dead.",
    "The Tea Lady neighbours two good players. The Assassin chooses to kill one of the Tea Lady’s neighbours, who dies even though they were protected by the Tea Lady.",
    "The Minstrel is in play. The Mastermind dies by execution. That night, the Assassin chooses to kill the Moonchild, but they do not die, because the Assassin is drunk due to the Minstrel.",
    "The Assassin, who was drunk due to the Courtier, chooses to kill the Goon. The Assassin has no ability, so the Goon remains alive but turns evil."
