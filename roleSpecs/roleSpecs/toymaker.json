  "summary": "Use the Toymaker to make small games take more time.\n-  If you created a character list using the Teensyville option in the Script Tool, then you may want to use the Toymaker. Games set in Teensyville have only six Townsfolk, two Outsiders, two Minions, and two Demons on the list, and they specifically cater to five or six players.\n-  With the Toymaker in play, the Demon learns three not-in-play characters at the start of the game, and the Minion(s) and Demon learn who each other are. Once per game, the Demon must voluntarily choose to attack nobody tonight. If the Demon is about wake to attack a player and this would end the game, but the Demon has not yet chosen to attack nobody, then the Storyteller does not wake the Demon—they are forced to attack nobody tonight.\n-  You may use the Toymaker in games of Trouble Brewing with five or six players, but it is not necessary.",
  "howToRun": "At the start of the game, declare that the Toymaker is in play.\nAdd the Toymaker token to the Grimoire, and mark the Demon with the Toymaker’s FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK reminder.\n\nOn the first night, resolve the \"Minion info\" and \"Demon info” steps on the night sheet even though there are fewer than seven players.\n\nEach night the Demon wakes, they may choose not to attack by shaking their head no. If they choose not to attack, remove the FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK reminder.\n\nDuring any night, if the Demon would wake and their attack could end the game, but the Demon is marked FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK, the Demon does not wake or act tonight.",
  "examples": [
    "On the second night, when five players are alive, the Imp chooses not to attack, which allows it to act during the final night. On the third night, when four players are alive, it kills a player.",
    "On the second night, the Imp kills a player. On the third night, when just three players are alive, the Imp cannot attack because it is the final night."
