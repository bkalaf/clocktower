  "summary": "The Zealot votes.\n-  If there are 5 or more players alive, the Zealot must vote for every nomination. If there are 4 or fewer players alive, the Zealot can choose whether they vote or not.\n-  Travellers count as alive players.\n-  The Zealot can vote like a normal dead player when dead.\n-  The Zealot does not need to vote for exiles.\n-  A Zealot must vote even if they think they might be drunk or poisoned.\n-  It is not the Storyteller's responsibility to monitor the Zealot. They're responsible for their own voting. Deliberately not voting when they should is considered cheating.",
  "howToRun": "During each nomination, if there are 5 or more players alive, the Zealot must raise their hand to vote.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tIf the Zealot accidentally forgets to vote, do not tally the Zealot's vote. If you do tally the vote, the total will be more than it should be, and all players will know which player is the Zealot, which is unfair for the evil team. Mistakes happen. Just play on and have a private chat later.",
  "examples": [
    "There are 7 players alive. The Zealot votes for the Alsaahir, the Summoner, Ogre, and the Banshee. The next day, there are 5 players alive. The Zealot votes for the Yaggababble, and the High Priestess. The next day, there are 3 players alive. The Zealot votes for the Yaggababble, but chooses not to vote for the High Priestess.",
    "There are 9 players alive. The Zealot is dead. The Zealot doesn't vote for 3 days, and uses their vote token when just 3 players are alive to vote for the Farmer."
