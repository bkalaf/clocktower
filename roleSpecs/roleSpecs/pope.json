  "summary": "The Pope creates duplicate character claims.\n-  A Townsfolk or an Outsider, or both, have multiple copies in play.\n-  There may be one character that has multiple copies in play, or multiple characters that have multiple copies in play.\n-  There may be 2 characters that are the same, or as many as the Storyteller has tokens to accommodate.\n-  These characters might be a part of the 3 bluffs given to the Demon.\n-  The Storyteller will need multiple copies of the game, or at least some way to access identical character tokens, in order to run this character... for now.\n-  Duplicate Outsider characters may cause an unusual number of Outsiders. Duplicate Townsfolk characters may not.",
  "howToRun": "During setup, swap any Townsfolk tokens for duplicates of an in-play Townsfolk or Outsider character token. You may do this more than once.\n\nDuring the DEMON INFO step, you may give the Demon one, two, or three of these duplicate character tokens as bluffs.\n\n \n\nThink carefully about giving in-play characters as bluffs to the Demon. Some characters may make the game too difficult for the evil team.",

    "Lewis and Abdallah are Generals. Evin is the Drunk who thinks he is a General. Alex and Julian are Zealots, and Marianna is the Xaan bluffing as a Zealot."
