  "summary": "The Butcher allows a second execution to occur per day.\n-  After the first executed player has died, the Butcher may nominate a second player for execution. The Butcher may nominate a player that has already been nominated today, and the Butcher may make a nomination even if the Butcher already made a nomination earlier today.\n-  If a player is executed, even if they do not die, then the Butcher may use their ability. The players may choose to vote or not to vote, so there is no guarantee that this extra nomination will cause an execution—it still needs to get enough votes—but this second nomination does not need to exceed the vote tally of the previous nominations.\n-  If no execution occurs today, then the Butcher may not use their ability at all today.",
  "howToRun": "Each day, immediately after a player is executed, the Butcher may nominate a player for execution. (Remind them if needed.) To succeed, this nomination must tally votes of at least half the alive players, as normal, but does not have to exceed the votes of the execution that prompted the Butcher ability. If this second execution succeeds, it does not allow the Butcher to nominate a third player.",
  "examples": [
    "The Witch is executed and dies. The Butcher then nominates the Sage, who gets enough votes to be executed. The Sage dies too.",
    "The  is exiled, and then the  is exiled. There are no executions today. The Butcher does not get to nominate again, because exiles are not executions.",
    "The Butcher nominates the Town Crier, but the Town Crier is not executed. The Mathematician gets more votes and is executed today. The game continues, and the Butcher nominates the Town Crier again. This time, enough hands are raised, and the Town Crier is executed."
