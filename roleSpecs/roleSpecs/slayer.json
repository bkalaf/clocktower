  "summary": "The Slayer can kill the Demon by guessing who they are.\n-  The Slayer can choose to use their ability at any time during the day, and must declare to everyone when they're using it. If the Slayer chooses the Demon, the Demon dies immediately. Otherwise, nothing happens.\n-  The players do not learn the identity of the dead player. After all, it may have been the Recluse!\n-  A Slayer that uses their ability while poisoned or drunk may not use it again.\n-  The Slayer will want to choose an alive player. Even if the Slayer chooses a dead Imp, nothing happens, because a dead player can't die again.\n-  Players may say whatever they want at any time, so a player who's pretending to be the Slayer may pretend to use the Slayer ability.",
  "howToRun": "During the day, the Slayer can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so, the Slayer points at any player. If the chosen player is an alive Demon, declare that the chosen player dies—put a shroud on their character token in the Grimoire. If the chosen player is not an alive Demon, say \"Nothing happens.\" Either way, the Slayer loses their ability—put the Slayer's NO ABILITY reminder token by the Slayer token.\n\nIf a player is bluffing as the Slayer and declares they wish to use their ability, act as if they were indeed the Slayer—allow time for discussion, let them make the decision, and act like you're fiddling with tokens in your Grimoire, then say \"Nothing happens.\"\n\nWhen the Slayer declares that they wish to use their ability, give the group a minute or two to discuss who the Slayer should choose. This allows the group to feel responsible for the win (or the loss!), but the Slayer always makes the final choice.",
  "examples": [
    "The Slayer chooses the Imp. The Imp dies, and good wins!",
    "The Slayer chooses the Recluse. The Storyteller decides that the Recluse registers as the Imp, so the Recluse dies, but the game continues.",
    "The Imp is bluffing as the Slayer. They declare that they use their Slayer ability on the Scarlet Woman. Nothing happens."
