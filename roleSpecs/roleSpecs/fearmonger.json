  "abilityText": "Each night, choose a player: if you nominate & execute them, their team loses. All players know if you choose a new player.",
  "summary": "The Fearmonger creates paranoia about who nominates whom.\n-  During the first night, when the Fearmonger selects a player, all players learn this.\n-  During other nights, each time the Fearmonger selects a new player, all players learn this. If the Fearmonger selects the same player as previously, the players learn nothing.\n-  The players only learn that the Fearmonger has acted, not which player was selected.\n-  If the Fearmonger nominates their chosen player, and that nomination results in their execution, the chosen player loses, their team loses, and the game ends.\n-  Only the currently chosen player is susceptible to the Fearmonger’s ability. Previously chosen players don’t count.\n-  If the chosen player is executed but does not die, the chosen player’s team still loses.",
  "howToRun": "Each night, wake the Fearmonger. They point at any player. Put the Fearmonger to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the FEAR reminder. If the Fearmonger chose a player who wasn’t already marked with the FEAR reminder, declare that “The Fearmonger has chosen a player.” (This informs the group that the Fearmonger is alive and has chosen a new player.)\n\nIf the Fearmonger nominates the player marked FEAR, and that nomination results in their execution, declare that the game is over and which team has won.",
  "examples": [
    "On the first night, the Fearmonger chooses the Butler. All players learn the Fearmonger has chosen a new player. During the day, the Fearmonger nominates the Butler, and the Butler is executed. Evil wins.",
    "At night, the Fearmonger chooses the Juggler. The Flowergirl nominates the Juggler, and the Juggler is executed. The game continues.",
    "The Fearmonger chooses the Empath. The next night, the Fearmonger chooses the Soldier. The Fearmonger nominates and executes the Empath. The game continues because the Fearmonger has selected the Soldier, not the Empath.",
    "The Fearmonger accidentally chooses the Baron, due to the Poppy Grower being in play. The Fearmonger nominates and executes the Baron. Good wins."
