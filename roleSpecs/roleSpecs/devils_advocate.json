  "summary": "The Devil's Advocate saves players from execution.\n-  Each night, the Devil’s Advocate chooses a player to protect from death by execution. The next day, if that player is executed, the execution succeeds but the player remains alive.\n-  The Devil’s Advocate cannot choose the same player two nights in a row, whether or not that player was saved from execution today, and they cannot choose a Zombuul that registers as dead.",
  "howToRun": "Each night, wake the Devil’s Advocate. They point at any player. Put the Devil’s Advocate to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the SURVIVES EXECUTION reminder.\n\nIf a player marked SURVIVES EXECUTION is executed, declare that the player was executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)",

    "The Devil's Advocate protects the Zombuul. The Zombuul is executed but remains alive, so their life token is not flipped. The next day, the Zombuul is executed again and registers as dead.",

The Tinker is executed, but the Storyteller kills the Tinker anyway, due to the Tinker ability.
