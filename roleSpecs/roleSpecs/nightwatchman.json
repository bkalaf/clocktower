  "summary": "The Nightwatchman is known by one player.\n-  At night, the Nightwatchman chooses a player. This player wakes, and learns which player the Nightwatchman is.\n-  The Nightwatchman and their chosen player do not make eye contact. They wake separately.\n-  The Nightwatchman player chooses which night to act.",
  "howToRun": "Each night, wake the Nightwatchman. The Nightwatchman either shakes their head or points at any player. Put the Nightwatchman to sleep.\n\nIf the Nightwatchman pointed at a player, wake them and show them the Nightwatchman token, then point to the Nightwatchman player. Put the chosen player to sleep. The Nightwatchman loses their ability – mark them with a NO ABILITY reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.",
  "examples": [
    "Lachlan is the Nightwatchman. He chooses Abdallah. Abdallah learns that Lachlan is the Nightwatchman.",
    "Marianna is the drunk Nightwatchman. She chooses Amy. Amy does not wake, and does not learn that Marianna is the Nightwatchman, because the Nightwatchman has no ability.",
    "Ben is the Nightwatchman and Vortox is in play. Ben chooses Sarah. Sarah learns that Lewis is the Nightwatchman. Even though the Nightwatchman has their ability, the information is false."
