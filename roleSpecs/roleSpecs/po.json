  "summary": "The Po can choose to attack nobody at night, but goes on a rampage the following night.\n-  The Po attacks one player per night, like many other Demons. However, if the Po chooses to attack nobody, then they may attack three players the following night.\n-  If the Po was drunk or poisoned when they chose nobody last night, they still choose three players tonight.\n-  A Po must choose three players when prompted to do so. They cannot choose no one again.\n-  The Po only gets three attacks if they chose nobody. The Po does not get three attacks if they chose to attack someone the previous night, but that player did not die.\n-  The Po doesn’t act on the first night, but this night does not count as a night where the Po “chose no one.”\n-  If the Exorcist selects the Po, the Po does not act, but this night does not count as a night where the Po “chose no one.” However, if the Po chose no one the night before the Exorcist chose the Po, the Po chooses three players the night after the Exorcist chose the Po, because their last choice was no one.",
  "howToRun": "Each night except the first, wake the Po. They either shake their head no or point at any player. Put the Po to sleep. If they shook their head no, mark the Po with the 3 ATTACKS reminder. If they chose a player, that player dies—mark them with a DEAD reminder.\n\nIf the Po wakes to act while marked 3 ATTACKS, they point at any three players, one at a time. In the order chosen, each chosen player dies—mark them with DEAD reminders. Remove the 3 ATTACKS reminder.",
  "examples": [
    "On the second night, the Po attacks one player. On the third night, the Po chooses to attack nobody. On the fourth night, the Po attacks three players.",
    "The Po chooses to attack nobody, but is drunk. The next night, the Po is poisoned. They choose three players, but none of them die. The following night, the Po is sober and healthy and attacks a player, who dies.",
    "The Po attacks the Moonchild, then the Goon, then the Grandmother. Only the Moonchild dies, because the Po became drunk when they attacked the Goon."
