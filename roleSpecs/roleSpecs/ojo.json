  "abilityText": "Each night*, choose a character: they die. If they are not in play, the Storyteller chooses who dies.",
  "summary": "The Ojo chooses specifically which character dies.\n-   Unlike other Demons, the Ojo must choose a character, not a player. The Storyteller may need to remind the player of this. We recommend that all players have their character sheet handy during the night phase.\n-   The Ojo can kill evil characters, if they wish.\n-  If there are multiple copies of a particular character in play, and the Ojo chooses that character to die, only one of those characters dies.\n-  If the Ojo chooses a character that is not in play, the Storyteller will almost always kill a living good player. It is possible, but uncommon, for the Storyteller to choose a dead player or an evil player to die.",
  "howToRun": "Each night except the first, wake the Ojo. The Ojo player points to a character icon on their character sheet. If that character is in play, that player dies—mark them with the “Dead” reminder. If that character is not in play, choose any player. That player dies—mark them with the “Dead” reminder. Put the Ojo to sleep.\n\nIf the Ojo is on a script with a Demon that kills multiple times per night, such as the Shabaloth, and the Ojo chooses a not-in-play character, you may choose more than one player to kill that night. This helps the Ojo player pretend that a different Demon is in play.",
  "examples": [
    "The Ojo chooses the Plague Doctor. The Plague Doctor dies. The next night, the Ojo chooses the Poppy Grower. The Poppy Grower dies. The next night, the Ojo chooses the Empath. There is no Empath in play, so the Storyteller chooses that the  Shugenja dies instead."
