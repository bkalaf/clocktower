  "summary": "The Sailor is either drunk or getting somebody else drunk. While the Sailor is sober, they can't die.\n-  Each night, the Sailor chooses a player, who will probably get drunk.\n-  If they choose themself, they lose their “cannot die” ability until they become sober.\n-  If the Sailor chooses a dead player accidentally, the Storyteller prompts them to choose again.\n-  If the Sailor chooses another player, the Storyteller chooses which player is drunk. If they choose a Townsfolk, the Storyteller will usually make the Townsfolk drunk, but if an Outsider, a Minion, or the Demon is chosen, then the Storyteller will usually make the Sailor the drunk one.\n-  While sober, the Sailor cannot die, even if they have not yet woken at night to go drinking.",
  "howToRun": "Each night, wake the Sailor. They point at any player. Put the Sailor to sleep. Either the Sailor or this chosen player becomes drunk—mark them with the DRUNK reminder.\n\nIf the sober Sailor would die, the Sailor remains alive. If the sober Sailor is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)",
  "examples": [
    "The Sailor chooses the Exorcist, and the Storyteller decides that the Exorcist is drunk. That night, the Sailor is attacked by the Shabaloth. The Sailor remains alive. The next day, the Sailor is executed but remains alive.",
    "During the day, the Gossip made a public statement they thought was false, but was actually true. That night, the Gossip ability kills a player. The Sailor has made themself drunk, and the Storyteller decides that the Sailor dies.",
    "The Sailor chooses the Mastermind, but the Storyteller decides that the Sailor is drunk. The next day, the Sailor asks to be executed to “prove they are the Sailor,” but dies because they're drunk."
