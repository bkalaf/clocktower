  "summary": "The Grandmother knows who their grandchild is, but if they are killed by the Demon, the Grandmother dies too.\n-  During the first night, the Grandmother learns their Grandchild—a good player who is a Townsfolk or Outsider. The Grandchild does not learn that they have a Grandmother.\n-  If the Demon kills the Grandchild, the Grandmother dies too. If the Grandchild dies by any other means—such as execution, or another type of death at night—the Grandmother does not also die.",
  "howToRun": "When preparing the first night, choose a Grandchild by marking any good character with the GRANDCHILD reminder.\n\nDuring the first night, wake the Grandmother and show them the character token marked GRANDCHILD, then point at the Grandchild player, then put the Grandmother to sleep.\n\nIf the Demon kills the Grandchild, the Grandmother dies - mark them with the DEAD reminder.",
  "examples": [
    "During the first night, the Grandmother wakes and learns that Julian, their Grandchild, is the Professor. Three nights later, Julian is killed by the Demon, so the Grandmother dies too.",
    "The Grandmother knows that Lewis, their Grandchild, is the Gambler. Lewis gambles and dies because of it. The Grandmother remains alive.",
    "The Grandmother knows that Sarah, their Grandchild, is the Tinker. Sarah is killed by the Demon, but the Grandmother is drunk because of the Sailor, so the Grandmother remains alive."
