  "summary": "The Clockmaker learns the distance from the Demon to their nearest Minion.\n-  The Clockmaker only learns this on the first night.\n-  The distance is the number of seated players, starting from the player next to the Demon and ending at the nearest Minion, either clockwise or counterclockwise.",
  "howToRun": "During the first night, wake the Clockmaker. Show fingers (1, 2, etc.) equaling the distance in players from the Demon to the nearest Minion, starting with the player neighboring the Demon closer to that Minion. Put the Clockmaker to sleep.",

    "The Fang Gu is sitting next to the Pit-Hag. During the first night, the Clockmaker learns a \"1\".",
    "Clockwise from the No Dashii sits the Dreamer, the Snake Charmer, then the Evil Twin. Counterclockwise from the No Dashii sits the Mutant, the Sweetheart, the Philosopher, the Sage, then the Witch. Because the Witch is five steps away from the Demon, and the Evil Twin is three steps away from the Demon, the Clockmaker learns a \"3\" during the first night.",
    "The Fang Gu neighbours two Travellers, one good and one evil. Neighboring one of these Travellers is a Cerenovus. During the first night, the Clockmaker learns a \"2\", because evil Travellers are not Minions."
