  "summary": "The Lunatic thinks that they are the Demon.\n-  Much like the Drunk, the Lunatic does not know their real character or real alignment. They are woken each night to attack as if they were the Demon that is in play, but their choices have no effect because they have no Demon ability.\n-  The Lunatic wakes during the first night to learn three bluffs and the appropriate number of Minions, but this information may be wrong.\n-  The real Demon knows which players the Lunatic chose to attack each night.",
  "howToRun": "While setting up the game, put the Lunatic and Demon tokens in the bag. Once all tokens have been returned to you, swap the positions of the Lunatic and Demon tokens in the Grimoire. \n\nDuring the first night, wake the Lunatic and act as if they are the Demon. Show them the THESE ARE YOUR MINIONS info token and point to a number of players equaling the number of Minions in play. (These can be any players, whether or not they are Minions.) Show any three good character tokens as bluffs. (These can even be characters that are in play.)\n\nDuring the first night, wake the Demon. Show them the YOU ARE info token, then their Demon token. (This tells them they are the real Demon.) Show them the THIS PLAYER IS info token, then the Lunatic token, then point at the Lunatic player. \n\nEach night, before the Demon wakes to attack, wake the Lunatic to act as if they were that Demon. Put a CHOSEN reminder on each player they chose, then put them to sleep. Wake the real Demon, point at the Lunatic, show the Lunatic token to the real Demon, and point at the players that the Lunatic chose. Then the Demon acts as normal.\n\nYou can make the Lunatic think they are a different Demon than the in-play Demon by instead putting two Demon tokens in the bag, then replacing one of them with the Lunatic token once they are in the Grimoire.",
  "examples": [
    "The Lunatic, thinking they are the Shabaloth, wakes each night to choose two players. The chosen players do not die.",
    "The Lunatic, thinking they are the Zombuul, does not wake often at night. The real Zombuul, who is pretending to be the Lunatic's Minion, often attacks the same players the Lunatic chooses, to keep up the illusion that the Lunatic is the Demon."
