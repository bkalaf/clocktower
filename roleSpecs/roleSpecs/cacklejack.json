  "summary": "The Cacklejack causes character-changing chaos.\n-  The Storyteller chooses one player to change character each night. This player can be evil or good, dead or alive.\n-  The Storyteller also chooses which character they become. This may be an in-play or a not-in-play character.\n-  Each day, the Cacklejack chooses a player that is immune - the Storyteller must choose a different player to change character that night.\n-  The Cacklejack may choose publicly or privately, but must choose during the day.\n-  Each time a player’s character changes, this is treated as a new instance of that character ability. For example, if a player becomes the Chef on Night 3, they immediately learn how many pairs of evil players there are.",
  "howToRun": "Each day, the Cacklejack chooses a player. Mark them with the NOT ME reminder.\n\nEach night, except the first, replace any player’s character token with a different character token. Wake that player. Show the YOU ARE info token, and their new character token, then put them to sleep.\n\n \nRemember that the night order is just a guide. The Cacklejack may act at any point in the night if you need it to.",
  "examples": [
    "During the day, the Cacklejack chooses Evin. That night, Amy changes from the Acrobat into the Clockmaker. Amy learns a 2.",
    "During the day, the Cacklejack chooses Abdallah. That night, Julian changes from the Drunk into the Flowergirl. Julian does not learn that he is now sober.",
    "During the day, the Cacklejack chooses Alex. That night, Lachlan changes from the Leviathan into the Shabaloth. Lachlan has fun."
