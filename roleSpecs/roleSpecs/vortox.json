  "abilityText": "Each night*, choose a player: they die. Townsfolk abilities yield false info. Each day, if no-one is executed, evil wins.",
  "summary": "The Vortox makes all information false.\n-  Anytime a Townsfolk player gets information from their ability, they get false information. Even if they are drunk or poisoned, it must be false.\n-  The Vortox does not affect information gained by other means, such as when the Storyteller explains the rules, or when a player’s character or alignment changes.\n-  When night falls, if nobody was executed today, evil wins. Exiling a Traveller does not count.",
  "howToRun": "While the Vortox is alive, you must give false information whenever a Townsfolk ability prompts you to give information.\n\nEach night except the first, wake the Vortox. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the DEAD reminder. Put the Vortox to sleep.\n\nEach dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil team wins.",
  "examples": [
    "The Vortox kills the Sage. The Sage learns two players, both of which are not Demons.",
    "Nobody voted or nominated today, but the Mutant is executed. That night, both the Flowergirl and the Town Crier learn a \"yes.”",
    "The Savant is in play, and learns two pieces of information each day. Both are false. That night, the Dreamer chooses a player who is the Savant, and learns that player is either the Philosopher or the No Dashii.",
    "The Pit-Hag turns the Juggler into the Witch. The Juggler learns that they are now the good Witch, because this information comes from the Pit-Hag's ability, not a Townsfolk's ability.",
    "Today, a player died from the Witch, two Travellers were exiled, 5 nominations happened, but nobody was executed. Evil wins."
