  "abilityText": "Once per game, during the day, privately ask the Storyteller any yes/no question.",
  "summary": "The Artist may ask any 1 question, and get an honest answer.\n-  The question may deal with anything at all, phrased in any way they want. The Storyteller honestly answers “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know.”\n-  It is up to the Artist to talk with the Storyteller, not the other way around. This isn’t a public conversation, and the group can’t listen in. It’s private.",
  "howToRun": "During any day, the Artist can request a private chat with you. Take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. They will ask you a question. Whisper “Yes,” “No,” or “I don’t know,” to them, or if you cannot answer in one of these ways, prompt the Artist to ask again in a different way. The Artist loses their ability - mark them with the NO ABILITY reminder.\n\nLike the Savant, evil players bluffing as the Artist may request a private chat with you and pretend to ask a question. To help them bluff, you can pretend to give an answer by nodding or shaking your head.",
  "examples": [
    "The Artist asks, \"Is the Demon sitting in a brown chair?\" The Storyteller answers, \"No,” because the Demon is in a black chair.",
    "The Artist asks, \"Is David the Evil Twin?” and the Storyteller answers, \"Yes,” because David is.",
    "The Artist asks, \"How many Minions are alive?” and the Storyteller says, \"Please ask another question. I cannot answer that with a yes, no, or I don't know.\"",
    "The Artist asks, \"Are we winning?” and the Storyteller answers, \"I don't know,” because even though all the Minions are dead, many good players trust the Demon."
