  "summary": "The Boffin replicates a good ability.\n-  While the Boffin is alive, the Demon has a single Townsfolk ability or Outsider ability.\n-  If the Demon is drunk or poisoned, the Demon keeps this good ability. If the Boffin is drunk or poisoned, the Demon temporarily loses this good ability.\n-  If the Demon dies and has an ability that functions while dead, such as the Sweetheart, the Demon keeps this ability.\n-  If a new Demon is created, such as via a Scarlet Woman or a Barber, this new Demon has an ability from the Boffin. This ability may be different to the previous Demon's ability.\n-  If there are multiple Demons alive, only one alive Demon has an ability from the Boffin.\n-  If the Demon has an ability that modifies the setup, such as a Choirboy, these changes are made during setup, as normal.\n-  Both the Demon and the Boffin learn which good ability the Demon has. The Storyteller may wake these players independently, or together.\n-  The not-in-play character may be 1 of the Demon's 3 bluffs.\n-  The Demon also wakes at night at the time that the good character would normally wake.",
  "howToRun": "While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, make any changes that are indicated in brackets on the Demon's two character abilities. Afterwards, place this second character token by the Demon character token. \n\nDuring the 1st night, wake the Boffin and the Demon. Show the THIS CHARACTER SELECTED YOU info token, then the Boffin token, then the good character token. Place this second character token by the Demon character token.\n\nTreat the Demon player as if they had this character ability, as well as their own Demon ability.\n\n \nGood abilities that would drunk/poison themselves, such as the Sailor, only drunk/poison the Demon's good ability.",
  "examples": [
    "The Imp has the Virgin ability. The Alsaahir nominates the Imp, and is immediately executed.",
    "The Lord of Typhon has the Chambermaid ability. Each night, the Lord of Typhon wakes, chooses two players, and learns how many woke tonight. On the 4th night, the Boffin is drunk, so the Demon has no Chambermaid ability, so does not wake.",
    "The Kazali has the Banshee ability. The Kazali dies at night, and the Scarlet Woman becomes the Kazali. The dead Kazali may nominate and vote twice per day."
