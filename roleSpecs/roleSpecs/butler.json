  "abilityText": "Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting too.",
  "summary": "The Butler may only vote when their Master (another player) votes.\n-  Each night, the Butler chooses a player to be their Master. This may be the same player as last night or a different one.\n-  If the Master has their hand raised to vote, or if the Master's vote has already been counted, the Butler may raise their hand to vote.\n-  If the Master has their hand down, signaling that they are not voting, or if the Master lowers their hand before their vote is tallied, the Butler must lower their hand too.\n-  It is not the Storyteller's responsibility to monitor the Butler. They're responsible for their own voting. Deliberately voting when they shouldn't is considered cheating.\n-  Because exiles are never affected by abilities, the Butler can vote freely for an exile.\n-  Dead players may only raise their hand to vote if they have a vote token. If the Butler chooses a dead player as their Master, this still applies.\n-  The Butler is never forced to vote.\n-  The Butler's vote may be tallied by the Storyteller before or after their Master's. Seating position is not important.",
  "howToRun": "Each night, wake the Butler. They point at any player. Mark this player with the MASTER reminder token. Put the Butler to sleep.\n\nDuring a nomination, the Butler may only have their hand raised to vote if the Master has their hand raised to vote or if the Master's vote has already been counted.\n\nIf the Butler accidentally votes illegally, tally the Butler's vote anyway. If you don't, the total will be less than it should be, and all players will know which player is the Butler, which is unfair for the evil team. Mistakes happen. Just play on and have a private chat later.",
  "examples": [
    "The Butler chooses Filip to be their Master. Tomorrow, if Filip raises his hand to vote on an execution, then the Butler may too. If not, then the Butler may not raise their hand.",
    "A nomination is in progress. The Butler and their Master both have their hands raised to vote. As the Storyteller is counting votes, the Master lowers their hand at the last second. The Butler must lower their hand immediately.",
    "The Butler is dead. Because dead players have no ability, the Butler may vote with their vote token at any time."
