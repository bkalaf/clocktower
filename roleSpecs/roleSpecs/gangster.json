  "summary": "The Gangster encourages their neighbors to kill each other.\n-  The Gangster may kill one of their two living neighbors. Their dead neighbors are skipped over, and do not count.\n-  To use their ability, the Gangster and one of their living neighbors must agree to kill the other living neighbor. The Storyteller must hear and confirm this agreement. The Gangster cannot kill without the Storyteller present.\n-  Each day, the Gangster may say whatever they want, and offer any encouraging words they want to either player. Once an agreement has been reached, then the Gangster may not use their ability again today, even if that player didn’t die due to an ability protecting them.\n-  The Gangster’s two living neighbors are always one clockwise, and one counter-clockwise.\n-  If both living neighbors want to kill the other, the Gangster decides who dies.",
  "howToRun": "Once per day, the Gangster can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so, ask if an alive neighbor agrees. If an alive neighbor agrees, the other alive neighbor dies. If both alive neighbors agree, the Gangster chooses which alive neighbor dies. If neither alive neighbor agrees, the Gangster may not use their ability today.",
  "examples": [
    "The Gangster neighbors the Saint and the Baron. The Gangster asks the Baron if they want to kill the Saint. The Baron agrees and the Saint dies.",
    "The Gangster neighbours the Chambermaid and the Poppy Grower, but they are both dead. The Gangster’s two living neighbours are the Engineer and the Po. The Gangster talks with the Po and offers to kill the Engineer. The Po declines. The Gangster talks with the Engineer and the Engineer asks the Gangster to kill the Po. The Gangster agrees, and the Po dies. Good wins.",
    "The Gangster neighbours the Fool and the Sage. The Sage and the Gangster kill the Fool but the Fool doesn’t die, because of the Fool's ability. The Gangster may not use their ability again today."
