  "summary": "The Psychopath kills in broad daylight.\n-  During the day, if the Psychopath declares that they are the Psychopath and publicly chooses a player, that player dies. This can only be done once per day, and only before the Storyteller has called for nominations.\n-  The Psychopath does not need to use this ability if they don’t want to.\n-  The Psychopath can be nominated and voted for normally. If the Psychopath is executed, they might not die. They play Roshambo (Paper-Rock-Scissors) with the player that nominated them. The nominator needs to win for the Psychopath to die. Drawing or losing means the Psychopath lives.\n-  If the Psychopath is executed, this still counts as the one execution for the day. No more players may be nominated or executed today.\n-  If the Psychopath dies by other means, such as the Demon attacking them, they do not play Roshambo. They die.",
  "howToRun": "Once per day, before you have called for nominations, the Psychopath may publicly choose a player. That player dies.\n\nIf the Psychopath is executed, the Psychopath and the nominator play a game of Roshambo. If the Psychopath loses, they die. If the Psychopath draws or wins, they live. Either way, the day ends, since there is only one execution per day.\n\nIf the Psychopath is executed due to a self-nomination, then the Psychopath plays Roshambo with you instead.",
  "examples": [
    "The Psychopath chooses to kill the Sailor. The Sailor is sober, so does not die. The Psychopath may not use their ability again today.",
    "The Psychopath has been nominated by the Barber, and is executed. In Roshambo, the Barber has rock and the Psychopath has rock, so the Psychopath lives. The next day, the Saint nominates and executes the Psychopath. The Saint has paper and the Psychopath has scissors, so the Psychopath lives. The next day, the Barber nominates and executes the Psychopath again. The Barber has rock and the Psychopath has scissors, so the Psychopath dies."
