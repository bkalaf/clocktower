  "summary": "The Mayor can win by peaceful means on the final day.\n-  To survive, the Mayor sometimes \"accidentally\" gets someone else killed. If the Mayor is attacked and would die, the Storyteller may choose that a different player dies. Nobody learns how they died at night, just that they died.\n-  If there are just three players alive at the end of the day, and no execution occurred that day, then the game ends and good wins.\n-  Travellers count as players for the Mayor's victory, so must be exiled first. Remember that exiles are not executions.\n-  Fabled don't count as players for the Mayor's victory, as the Storyteller isn't a player.\n-  If the Demon attacks the Mayor, and the Storyteller instead chooses a dead player, the Soldier, or a player protected by the Monk, that player does not die tonight.",
  "howToRun": "During the night, if the Mayor would die, you choose if the Mayor actually dies, or if the Mayor remains alive and another character dies instead—put the Demon's DEAD reminder token by that character token instead of the Mayor, and put a shroud on that character token instead of the Mayor.\n\nAt dawn, declare that the player marked DEAD died at night. (Do not say how they died.)\n\nAt dusk, if exactly three players are alive and no player was executed today, declare that the game ends and good wins.\n\n \n\nWe recommend you keep the Mayor alive until the final day, since it is most fun for the players that way. On rare occasions, if the group is overwhelmingly convinced early in the game that the Mayor is the Mayor, let the Mayor die so that evil has a chance to win. \n\nIn TROUBLE BREWING, the Mayor’s phrase “your team wins” will always mean “good wins” because the Mayor is always good. In other editions, an evil Mayor means “evil wins” instead.",
  "examples": [
    "The Imp attacks the Mayor. The Storyteller chooses that the Ravenkeeper dies instead.",
    "There are three players alive. There are no nominations for execution today. Good wins.",
    "There are five players alive, including two Travellers. Both Travellers are exiled, and the vote is tied between the remaining players. Because a tied vote means neither player is executed, good wins."
