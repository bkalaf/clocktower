  "abilityText": "Once per game, if another player nominated, you may choose to force the current execution to pass or fail.",
  "summary": "The Judge can determine if an execution succeeds or not, regardless of who voted. \n-  The Judge can decide to pardon a player that they think is innocent, to condemn a player that they think is guilty, or vice versa.\n-  If the nominee is pardoned, then they are not executed today, and none of the votes for them count. If the nominee is condemned, then they are executed immediately, regardless of how many votes they received, and regardless of whether another player was about to die by execution. Then the day ends, because there can normally only be one execution per day.\n-  The Judge may use their ability during or after the votes are tallied. However, once a new player has been nominated, then the Judge may only use their ability on this new nominee. The Judge may only use their ability once, and only if a different player made a nomination.",
  "howToRun": "At any time during a nomination for execution—from the moment that the nomination is declared to the moment before a new player is nominated for execution—the Judge can declare that this execution succeeds or fails. If the Judge declares that it succeeds, the nominated player is executed and you may proceed to the night phase (as there may only be one execution per day). If the Judge declares that it fails, the nominated player is no longer about to die and they are treated as receiving zero votes for execution, and the nomination process continues. The Judge loses their ability—put the Judge’s NO ABILITY reminder token by the Judge token.",
  "examples": [
    "The Slayer was about to die, but the Po is nominated and every alive player votes, so now the Po is about to die. The evil Judge decides that the Po’s execution fails. So, as before, the Slayer is about to die, and the nomination process continues.",
    "The good Judge nominates the Professor. Nobody votes, but the Judge may not use their ability. A Traveller's exile is voted on. Once again, the Judge may not use their ability. The Grandmother nominates the Goon. Even though the Goon got only one vote, the Judge decides that the Goon is executed immediately."
