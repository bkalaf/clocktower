  "howToRun": "If the Saint dies by execution, declare that the game ends and evil wins.\n\nThe Saint's ability has the strange phrase \"your team loses.\" In Trouble Brewing, this will always mean \"evil wins\" because the Saint is always good. In other editions, it is possible for characters to change alignment. If the evil Saint is executed, good wins.",

    "There are seven players alive and nominations are in progress. The Saint gets four votes and is about to die. Then, the Baron is nominated but only gets three votes. No more nominations occur today. The Saint is executed, and evil wins.",

    "The Saint is executed. However, the  's ability is triggered, so the  dies instead. The game continues, because the Saint did not die."
