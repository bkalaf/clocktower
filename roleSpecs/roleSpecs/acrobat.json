If the player is drunk or poisoned, the Acrobat dies.\n-  If the Acrobat is drunk or poisoned, they cannot die to their own ability.\n-  The Acrobat may choose any player, dead or alive, even themself.\n-  If the chosen player is sober and healthy at the time the Acrobat picks, but becomes drunk or poisoned later in the night, the Acrobat dies.\n-  The Acrobat does not learn if the player they selected was drunk, or poisoned, or both.\n-  The Drunk registers as drunk to the Acrobat.",
