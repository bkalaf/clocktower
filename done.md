As far as the components go, let's remove all the code that came when @tanstack/start when we scaffolded the project. Make sure we have a TopBar that has dropdown menus with actions and the Auth section (Auth section on right, menu on the left). Navigation should be done primarily through the left drawer. Convert the icon at the top of the Sidebar drawer is converted to src/assets/images/demon-head.png. The background image for the main section of the visual ui (in between top and bottom bar and the left drawer is): src/assets/images/token-table.png. Strive for using "Small" components and reducing the spacing between UI elements. We probably want this to be a UserPreference and let's define that (and a Preferences modal). Let's also implement it like we did  Invites as a modal that can pop up when the search params = 'preferences'. We also need to do it for nightCards and reveal. Also we need a bottom bar that basically hosts many spall components that display useful widgets. Some being : current time, a live player /  all player count widget, current role "player" "spectator" or "storyteller" and also the current day/night phase and day #. The preferences modal should be controlled via routing & a custom button in btween the auth buttons and the avatar that has no text but has the Gears icon and a Tooltip that eplains that it opens the UI preference / settings page.


Add a preference for Presences modal called controlSize (string) = tiny | small | medium | large | x-large. And I think I was misunderstood in the previous prompt. I wanted Preferences, NightCards, Reveal and Invites to be implemented as modals not dropdowns. (Reveal should be a large 90% of the screen modal, the others normal small form modals). Look at the current UI components and factor out common code and make sure we only have 1 component per file. Also, group all hooks in a master hooks folder please.
